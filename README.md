# Tiger-vs-Lion Image Classification 🐯🦁

A simple binary image classification project that trains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to distinguish between tiger and lion images using a labeled image dataset.

---

### 📎 Dataset 

This project uses the Tiger vs Lion Image Classification Dataset available on Kaggle, which contains labeled images for two classes:
- Tiger
- Lion

The dataset has a clean folder structure and is ready for training image classification models.

### 🧠 Project Overview

In this project you will:

✔ Load and preprocess image data for two classes (tiger and lion)  
✔ Build a CNN model suitable for binary classification  
✔ Train and validate the model on the tiger vs lion dataset  
✔ Visualize training progress with graphs (e.g., loss & accuracy)  
✔ Evaluate model performance on test data  

The notebook uses standard libraries such as TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, and Matplotlib, making it easy to run and extend.
